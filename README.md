The core objective of this project was to analyze and visualize a list of 19 unique genes for functional crosstalk and categorize them into ferritinophagy pathways between two genes: ATM and NCOA4.  NCOA4 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 4) and ATM (Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated) are proteins critical to cellular processes but operate in seperate pathways. NCOA4 is best known for its role in iron homeostasis and regulating the release of intracellular iron. ATM is important to sereine/threonin protein kinase and is a major senesor of DNA damage. ATM can phosphorylate NCOA4, and this phosphorylation event promotes the NCOA4-ferritin interaction, which in turn sustains ferritinophagy and increase the release of iron. 
Using a dataset of 100 genetic co-dependencies from DepMap, I was able to cross-examine the results of the same querey from GeneMANIA, another databank that creates functional associations between genes. After this I inputed the datasets as csv's where I did my preprocessing. The initial list of genes was complex, touching on diverse areas including iron metabolism, DNA integrity, and immunity.
The final results show the potential connections between these two genes and is ready for publication.
